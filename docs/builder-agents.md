# Builder Agent Templates

PilotSwarm ships distributable template files for Copilot custom agents that help users build apps on top of PilotSwarm.

These are not runtime agents inside PilotSwarm. They are authoring-time helpers meant to be copied into another repository.

## Template Source

In this repo, the templates live in:

`templates/builder-agents/`

That folder is intentionally non-active. Nothing there is loaded into this repository's own `.github/agents/` surface.

## Included Templates

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder`
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder`
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer`

## Install Into Another Repository

Copy the contents into the target repository as:

```text
.github/
├── agents/
└── skills/
```

Example install commands:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/agents .github/skills
cp templates/builder-agents/agents/*.agent.md .github/agents/
cp -R templates/builder-agents/skills/* .github/skills/
```

## Design Intent

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder` helps users build plugin-driven CLI/TUI apps on top of the shipped PilotSwarm UI.
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder` helps users build SDK-first services and applications around `PilotSwarmClient` and `PilotSwarmWorker`.
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer` helps users package and deploy PilotSwarm-based apps to Azure / AKS, with explicit env-template and cross-cluster workload-identity guidance.

The CLI and SDK builder templates are intended to be guided builders, not guess-heavy code generators. They should ask about session policy, env-file setup, initial agent roster, and target topology before scaffolding files.

Builder templates should assume:

- npm packages are consumed as `pilotswarm-sdk` and `pilotswarm-cli`
- PilotSwarm's built-in framework and management plugins are embedded in those packages
- app `default.agent.md` files are overlays layered under the embedded PilotSwarm framework base
- if an app needs a custom model catalog, `.model_providers.json` is checked in and secrets stay in `.env` / `.env.remote`
- builder templates should not invent or require a `.model_providers.example.json`

## Maintenance Rule

When PilotSwarm gains features or changes builder-relevant behavior, update these template agents and skills alongside the docs and examples they reference.
