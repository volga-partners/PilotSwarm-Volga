# PilotSwarm — Architecture

## 1. Design Philosophy

PilotSwarm is a **transparent durability layer underneath the GitHub Copilot SDK**. A developer using the Copilot SDK should be able to switch to the durable version with minimal code changes and gain:

- **Crash resilience** — sessions survive process restarts
- **Durable timers** — agents can wait hours/days without holding a process
- **Multi-node scaling** — sessions run on worker pods, relocatable across nodes
- **Offline continuity** — disconnect, reconnect, pick up where you left off

The API surface mirrors the Copilot SDK exactly. Internally, each SDK call is "remoted" through a duroxide orchestration to a worker node where a real `CopilotSession` runs. The developer never sees orchestrations, activities, event queues, or blob stores.

### Core Principles

1. **Close SDK semantics with durable additions** — Core chat flow mirrors Copilot SDK (`createSession`, `send`, `sendAndWait`, `on`, `abort`), with durability-oriented behavior differences (`destroy` maps to client delete flow, orchestration-backed state, CMS-backed event replay).

2. **Orchestration as mediator** — The duroxide orchestration is the sole coordinator between user intent (client) and LLM execution (worker). It makes all durable decisions: timers, dehydration, abort handling. Neither the activity nor the client makes durable decisions.

3. **CMS as the session catalog** — A PostgreSQL schema (`copilot_sessions`) holds session metadata (state, title, model, timestamps) and persisted events. The client writes lifecycle metadata (create/update/delete), while the worker records non-ephemeral runtime events. Duroxide state is eventually consistent with CMS.

4. **Activities as thin API calls** — Activities are the durable boundary between orchestration and session. They dispatch to the `ManagedSession` interface, not implement business logic. The `ManagedSession` owns the real `CopilotSession` and its lifecycle.

5. **Session affinity without session destruction** — When an activity yields (wait, input_required, completed), the `CopilotSession` stays alive in the `SessionManager` on the worker node. The next activity invocation finds it there. Dehydration to blob is a scale-to-zero / relocation mechanism, not a per-yield tax.

6. **`send()` + `on()` over `sendAndWait()`** — Internally, we never call `sendAndWait()`. We call `send()` and subscribe to events via `on()`. This gives us granular control: intercept tool calls before they execute, stream deltas, detect wait/input requests as they happen, and abort precisely.

## 2. Value Propositions

| Capability | Copilot SDK (vanilla) | PilotSwarm |
|---|---|---|
| **Crash recovery** | Session lost if process dies | Orchestration survives, session rehydrates from blob |
| **Long waits** | `setTimeout` — process must stay alive | Durable timer — process can die, wake on any node by default, or preserve worker affinity when requested |
| **Scaling** | Single process, single machine | N worker pods, session affinity + relocation |
| **Offline reconnect** | Must re-create session, history lost | CMS has full event log, cursor-based catch-up |
| **Observability** | Events visible only in-process | All events persisted to CMS, traceable across nodes |
| **Session naming** | UUID only | User-friendly names stored in CMS |
| **Multi-client** | One client per session | Multiple clients can read the same session's events from CMS |

---

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Logical View — The Orchestration as Coordination Layer

The system has two endpoints — the **client** (user intent) and the **CopilotSession** (LLM execution). Between them sits the **orchestration**, which is the coordination and async layer. It does not add business logic; it adds durable infrastructure:

| Capability | What the orchestration adds |
|---|---|
| **Crash resilience** | Orchestration state survives process restarts. If a worker dies mid-turn, the orchestration retries on another node. |
| **Durable timers** | `scheduleTimer()` persists in PG. Process can die, pod can scale to zero, timer still fires. |
| **Scale-out / relocation** | Affinity keys pin sessions to a node; resetting the key after dehydration allows any node to pick up the session. |
| **Async mediation** | The orchestration races user messages against running turns and timers — coordinating two async streams (user + LLM) durably. |

```

Five components, three data stores:

- **Client** owns session lifecycle in **CMS** — it writes to CMS first (create, update state, soft-delete), then makes the corresponding duroxide call (startOrchestration, enqueueEvent, cancelInstance). Reads session lists and metadata from CMS directly. Sends prompts and control messages to the orchestration via `enqueueEvent`.
- **Copilot Instance Orchestration** is the durable coordinator. It makes all durable decisions (timers, dehydration, abort routing) and calls into the **SessionManager** and **SessionProxy** on the worker. It never touches CMS.
- **SessionManager** owns in-memory session lifecycle on the worker (create, resume, destroy, dehydrate). Writes session state tars to **Blob Store** during dehydration/hydration.
- **SessionProxy** (one per active session) wraps a real **Copilot SDK/CLI Session**. Executes LLM turns and returns results to the orchestration.
- **CMS** (PostgreSQL) holds the session catalog — metadata, state, titles, timestamps, and session events. The **client** writes lifecycle metadata and the **worker** writes runtime events. Duroxide orchestration state is eventually consistent with CMS. CMS is accessed through the `SessionCatalogProvider` interface, allowing alternative backends (e.g. CosmosDB) in the future.

### 3.1.1 Activities as the SessionProxy

Activities are **not** a logic layer. They exist solely as the mechanism for the orchestration (which runs in the duroxide replay engine) to call methods on the `SessionManager` and `ManagedSession` (which run in normal async code on the worker).

To make this transparent, we define two proxies that replicate the worker-side interfaces using `scheduleActivity` calls. The orchestration code uses these proxies instead of raw activity names, so it reads like direct method calls.

#### SessionManagerProxy

The `SessionManagerProxy` represents the orchestration's view of the `SessionManager` singleton on the worker. In the current implementation it exposes only global operations that do not require session affinity:

```typescript
/**
 * SessionManagerProxy — orchestration's view of the SessionManager.
 * Operations that manage the session catalog or don't require session affinity.
 */
function createSessionManagerProxy(ctx: any) {
    return {
        listModels() {
            return ctx.scheduleActivity("listModels", {});
        },
    };
}
```

#### SessionProxy

The `SessionProxy` represents the orchestration's view of a specific `ManagedSession` on a specific worker node (via affinity key). It wraps the session-scoped activity calls used by the orchestration:

```typescript
/**
 * SessionProxy — orchestration's view of a specific ManagedSession.
 * Each method maps 1:1 to an activity dispatched to the session's worker node.
 */
function createSessionProxy(ctx: any, sessionId: string, affinityKey: string, config: SessionConfig) {
    return {
        runTurn(prompt: string) {
            return ctx.scheduleActivityOnSession(
                "runTurn", { sessionId, prompt, config }, affinityKey
            );
        },
        dehydrate(reason: string) {
            return ctx.scheduleActivityOnSession(
                "dehydrateSession", { sessionId, reason }, affinityKey
            );
        },
        hydrate() {
            return ctx.scheduleActivityOnSession(
                "hydrateSession", { sessionId }, affinityKey
            );
        },
        destroy() {
            return ctx.scheduleActivityOnSession(
                "destroySession", { sessionId }, affinityKey
            );
        },
    };
}
```

The orchestration then reads naturally:

```typescript
const manager = createSessionManagerProxy(ctx);
let session = createSessionProxy(ctx, input.sessionId, affinityKey, input.config);

// Reads like a normal API
const result = yield session.runTurn(prompt);
yield session.dehydrate("idle-timeout");

// After affinity reset, get a new proxy pointing to the (potentially different) node
affinityKey = yield ctx.newGuid();
session = createSessionProxy(ctx, input.sessionId, affinityKey, input.config);
yield session.hydrate();

// Manager-level operation (no affinity needed)
const models = yield manager.listModels();
```

#### Activity-to-Interface Mapping

**SessionProxy (session-scoped, affinity-pinned):**

| SessionProxy method | Activity | Worker-side call |
|---|---|---|
| `session.runTurn(prompt)` | `"runTurn"` | `sessionManager.getOrCreate(id, cfg).runTurn(prompt)` |
| `session.dehydrate(reason)` | `"dehydrateSession"` | `sessionManager.dehydrate(id, reason)` |
| `session.hydrate()` | `"hydrateSession"` | `blobStore.hydrate(id)` |
| `session.destroy()` | `"destroySession"` | `sessionManager.destroySession(id)` |

**SessionManagerProxy (global, no affinity):**

| SessionManagerProxy method | Activity | Worker-side call |
|---|---|---|
| `manager.listModels()` | `"listModels"` | `copilotClient.listModels()` |

All activity bodies are one-liners. All logic lives in `ManagedSession` (turn execution, event handling) and the orchestration (state machine, timers, dehydration decisions). The activities and proxies are pure plumbing.

> **Convention for the rest of this document:** Since the activity layer is mechanical — each activity is a one-liner that calls the corresponding `SessionManager` or `ManagedSession` method — we omit it from further discussion. When the orchestration calls `session.runTurn(prompt)`, understand that this goes through the `SessionProxy` → activity → `SessionManager.getOrCreate(id).runTurn(prompt)` on the worker. We talk only about the **orchestration** and the **SessionManager / ManagedSession** from here on.

### 3.3 Data Flow Summary

| Flow | Path | Mechanism | Durable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompt** (client → LLM) | Client → CMS update (state=running) → duroxide event queue → orchestration → ManagedSession → CopilotSession | CMS write + `enqueueEvent("messages")` | Yes — queued in PG |
| **Response** (LLM → client) | CopilotSession → ManagedSession → orchestration `customStatus` → client `waitForStatusChange()` | duroxide custom status | Ephemeral (CMS event log is Phase 2) |
| **Session lifecycle** | Client → CMS (create/update/delete) → duroxide (start/cancel orchestration) | CMS write-first, duroxide eventually consistent | Yes — CMS is source of truth |
| **Real-time status** | Orchestration → `customStatus` → client `waitForStatusChange()` | duroxide custom status | No — ephemeral per execution |
| **Abort** (client → LLM) | Client → event queue → orchestration → cancels running turn → `copilotSession.abort()` | `enqueueEvent({type: "abort"})` | Yes — through orchestration |
| **Dehydration** | Orchestration → `session.dehydrate()` → SessionManager → blob | AWS S3 | Yes |

### 3.4 Session Catalog (CMS)

The CMS is a PostgreSQL schema that stores session metadata. It is the **source of truth** for session lifecycle — the client writes to CMS before making duroxide calls, and reads from CMS for session listings and info.

#### 3.4.1 Provider Model

CMS access is abstracted behind the `SessionCatalogProvider` interface so different backends can be plugged in:

```typescript
interface SessionCatalogProvider {
    initialize(): Promise<void>;

    // Writes (from client, before duroxide calls)
    createSession(sessionId: string, opts: { model?: string }): Promise<void>;
    updateSession(sessionId: string, updates: Partial<SessionRow>): Promise<void>;
    softDeleteSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;

    // Reads (from client)
    listSessions(): Promise<SessionRow[]>;
    getSession(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionRow | null>;
    getLastSessionId(): Promise<string | null>;
}
```

The initial implementation is `PgSessionCatalogProvider` (PostgreSQL via `pg`). A CosmosDB provider can be added later with the same interface.

#### 3.4.2 Schema

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS copilot_sessions;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS copilot_sessions.sessions (
    session_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    orchestration_id  TEXT,              -- null until first turn starts
    title             TEXT,              -- LLM-generated 3-5 word summary
    state             TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    model             TEXT,
    created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    last_active_at    TIMESTAMPTZ,
    deleted_at        TIMESTAMPTZ,       -- soft delete
    current_iteration INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_error        TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sessions_state
    ON copilot_sessions.sessions(state) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sessions_updated
    ON copilot_sessions.sessions(updated_at DESC) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### 3.4.3 Write Path (Client → CMS → Duroxide)

All session lifecycle commands follow the same pattern: **write to CMS first, then make the duroxide call**. If the duroxide call fails, CMS is still correct — the reconciler (Phase 3) will detect and fix the inconsistency.

| Client method | CMS write | Then duroxide call |
|---|---|---|
| `createSession()` | `INSERT INTO sessions (session_id, state='pending', orchestration_id=NULL)` | — (orchestration starts lazily on first send) |
| `_startAndWait()` / `_startTurn()` | `UPDATE sessions SET orchestration_id=$1, state='running', last_active_at=now()` | `startOrchestration()` + `enqueueEvent()` |
| `deleteSession()` | `UPDATE sessions SET deleted_at=now()` | `cancelInstance()` |
| `resumeSession()` | — (session already exists in CMS) | — |

#### 3.4.4 Read Path (CMS → Client)

| Client method | CMS query |
|---|---|
| `listSessions()` | `SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY updated_at DESC` |
| `_getSessionInfo()` | `SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE session_id = $1` — merged with duroxide `customStatus` for live fields (pendingQuestion, waitingUntil) |
| `getLastSessionId()` | `SELECT session_id FROM sessions ORDER BY last_active_at DESC LIMIT 1` |

#### 3.4.5 Fallback

When no `SessionCatalogProvider` is configured (e.g. SQLite mode for local dev/tests), all methods fall back to the existing duroxide-status-based approach (`listAllInstances()`, `getStatus()` → `customStatus`). CMS is additive — nothing breaks without it.

#### 3.4.6 Consistency Model

CMS → duroxide is **write-first, eventually consistent**:

```
client.createSession()
  1. CMS:     INSERT session (state=pending, orchestration_id=null)  ✓ committed
  2. duroxide: (nothing yet — orchestration starts on first send)

client.sendAndWait(prompt)
  1. CMS:     UPDATE session (state=running, orchestration_id=X)     ✓ committed
  2. duroxide: startOrchestration(X) + enqueueEvent(prompt)          ✓ committed
  3. (poll customStatus for real-time turn result)

client.deleteSession()
  1. CMS:     UPDATE session (deleted_at=now())                      ✓ committed
  2. duroxide: cancelInstance(orchestrationId)                       ✓ best effort
```

If step 2 fails in any of these, CMS is still correct. A future **reconciler orchestration** (always-on, periodic) will scan CMS for sessions in inconsistent states (e.g. `state=pending` with no orchestration, or `deleted_at` set but orchestration still running) and fix them.

## 4. Lifecycle

### 4.1 Orchestration Instance Lifecycle

One orchestration instance per session. Long-lived, uses `continueAsNew` to bound history.

                    |    +------------------------+               |
                    |                                             |
                    |  On continueAsNew: new execution, same      |
                    |  instance ID. Session stays alive on node.  |
                    +---------------------------------------------+
```

States:
- **idle** — dequeue loop, waiting for next user message
- **running** — `session.runTurn()` executing on worker
- **waiting** — durable timer active (wait tool)
- **input_required** — waiting for user to answer a question
- **completed** — orchestration terminated normally (rare — sessions are long-lived)
- **failed** — unrecoverable error

                                                        +---------+
```

Key: the session stays alive across orchestration turns. Multiple `runTurn()` calls hit the same `CopilotSession` instance. Dehydration only happens on explicit orchestration decision (idle timeout, long timer, graceful shutdown).

### 4.3 Relocatability

A session can move between worker nodes:

```
Worker A: session active (in SessionManager memory)
  |
  +-- idle timeout / long timer / SIGTERM
  |
  +-- 1. ManagedSession.destroy() --> CopilotSession.destroy()
  |      +-- CLI flushes conversation state to ~/.copilot/session-state/{id}/
  +-- 2. tar + upload to S3
  +-- 3. Remove local files
  +-- 4. Orchestration resets affinityKey (newGuid)
  |
  v
  Session is now "dehydrated" -- no worker owns it

Worker B: next orchestration turn (any worker, affinity key is new)
  |
  +-- 1. session.hydrate(): download tar from blob, extract to local disk
  +-- 2. session.runTurn(): SessionManager.getOrCreate(id)
  |      +-- detects local files --> CopilotClient.resumeSession(id)
  |      +-- full conversation history restored
  +-- 3. ManagedSession wraps the new CopilotSession
  |      +-- session is now live on this node
  +-- Session is now active on Worker B
```

## 5. API Mapping — Copilot SDK → PilotSwarm

### 5.1 Client Methods

| Copilot SDK | PilotSwarm | Implementation | Differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| `new CopilotClient(opts?)` | `new PilotSwarmClient(opts)` | Constructor. `opts.store` required. | Adds durable options (`store`, dehydration thresholds, blobEnabled). |
| `client.start()` | `client.start()` | Creates duroxide `Client`; initializes CMS for PostgreSQL stores. | Worker runtime is separate (`PilotSwarmWorker.start()`). |
| `client.stop()` | `client.stop()` | Disposes client handle; leaves worker/runtime independent. | Lightweight client stop. |
| `client.createSession(config?)` | `client.createSession(config?)` | Creates CMS session row; orchestration starts lazily on first send. | Supports serializable config + in-memory tool references. |
| `client.resumeSession(id, config?)` | `client.resumeSession(id, config?)` | Returns `PilotSwarmSession` handle for existing session ID. | No immediate worker call. |
| `client.listSessions()` | `client.listSessions()` | Reads from CMS `sessions` table. | Returns `PilotSwarmSessionInfo[]`. |
| `client.deleteSession(id)` | `client.deleteSession(id)` | Soft-delete in CMS + best-effort orchestration cancel. | Durable delete behavior (not SDK disk semantics). |

### 5.2 Session Methods

| Copilot SDK | PilotSwarm | Implementation | Differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session.sessionId` | `session.sessionId` | Same — `readonly string`. | — |
| `session.send(opts)` | `session.send(prompt)` | Enqueues a prompt to orchestration and returns immediately. | Durable async send semantics. |
| `session.sendAndWait(opts, timeout?)` | `session.sendAndWait(prompt, timeout?)` | Sends prompt and waits for orchestration turn completion via status polling. | Returns assistant content string. |
| `session.on(type, handler)` | `session.on(type, handler)` | Polls CMS `session_events` with a sequence cursor and dispatches callbacks. | Durable cross-process subscriptions. |
| `session.abort()` | `session.abort()` | Cancels orchestration instance (best-effort current turn cancellation). | Session remains reusable. |
| `session.destroy()` | `session.destroy()` | Calls client delete flow for this session. | Durable delete path through CMS + orchestration cancel. |
| `session.getMessages()` | `session.getMessages()` | Reads persisted events from CMS. | Returns `SessionEvent[]`. |
| *N/A* | `session.getInfo()` | Merges CMS metadata + orchestration custom status. | Durable status/iteration visibility. |

### 5.3 Prompt API Shape

`PilotSwarmSession` currently uses string-based prompt methods:

```typescript
await session.send("hello");
await session.sendAndWait("hello", 60000);
```

This keeps the orchestration payloads minimal and serializable.

## 6. Hello World Example

### 6.1 Copilot SDK (Non-Durable)

```typescript
import { CopilotClient, defineTool } from "@github/copilot-sdk";

const getWeather = defineTool("get_weather", {
    description: "Get current weather for a city",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: { city: { type: "string" } },
        required: ["city"],
    },
    handler: async ({ city }) => {
        return { temp: 72, conditions: "sunny", city };
    },
});

const client = new CopilotClient({
    githubToken: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,  // standard Copilot SDK
});

const session = await client.createSession({
    model: "claude-sonnet-4",
    tools: [getWeather],
    systemMessage: "You are a helpful weather assistant.",
});

session.on("assistant.message", (event) => {
    console.log("Assistant:", event.data.content);
});

session.on("tool.execution_start", (event) => {
    console.log(`Calling tool: ${event.data.toolName}`);
});

const response = await session.sendAndWait({ prompt: "What's the weather in NYC?" });
console.log("Final:", response?.data.content);

await session.destroy();
await client.stop();
```

### 6.2 PilotSwarm

```typescript
import { PilotSwarmClient, defineTool } from "pilotswarm-sdk";

const getWeather = defineTool("get_weather", {
    description: "Get current weather for a city",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: { city: { type: "string" } },
        required: ["city"],
    },
    handler: async ({ city }) => {
        return { temp: 72, conditions: "sunny", city };
    },
});

const client = new PilotSwarmClient({
    store: process.env.DATABASE_URL,        // ← the only new required option
});

await client.start();

const session = await client.createSession({
    model: "claude-sonnet-4",
    tools: [getWeather],
    systemMessage: "You are a helpful weather assistant.",
});

session.on("assistant.message", (event) => {
    console.log("Assistant:", event.data.content);
});

session.on("tool.execution_start", (event) => {
    console.log(`Calling tool: ${event.data.toolName}`);
});

const response = await session.sendAndWait({ prompt: "What's the weather in NYC?" });
console.log("Final:", response?.data.content);

await session.destroy();
await client.stop();
```

**Differences: 3 lines.**
1. Import from `pilotswarm` instead of `@github/copilot-sdk`
2. Add `store: process.env.DATABASE_URL` to constructor
3. Add `await client.start()` (duroxide runtime needs explicit start)

Everything else is identical. The `on()` handlers fire the same events. The `sendAndWait()` returns the same `AssistantMessageEvent`. The tools work the same way.

### 6.3 Durable-Only Features

Once durable, you get additional capabilities for free:

```typescript
// Session survives restarts — resume by ID
const session = await client.resumeSession("my-session-id");

// Catch up on events you missed while offline
session.on("assistant.message", handler, { after: savedCursor });

// Name your sessions
await client.renameSession(session.sessionId, "Weather Bot");

// Agents get durable timer tools automatically
await session.send({ prompt: "Check the weather every hour and alert me if it rains" });
// For recurring schedules, the agent should call cron(3600, "...") once and let the orchestration own the loop
// For a one-shot durable delay, the agent calls wait(...)
// If the wait depends on worker-local state, the agent can call wait_on_worker(...) or wait(..., preserveWorkerAffinity: true)

// List all sessions with names and status
const sessions = await client.listSessions();
// → [{sessionId: "abc", name: "Weather Bot", state: "waiting", ...}]

// Per-session info can include live cron/context-window metadata
const info = await session.getInfo();
// → { cronActive: true, cronInterval: 3600, contextUsage: { currentTokens, tokenLimit, ... } }

// Scale to multiple workers
const client = new PilotSwarmClient({
    store: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    blobEnabled: true,  // enables relocation when S3-backed worker storage is configured
    maxSessionsPerRuntime: 50,
});
```

---

## 7. Implementation Detail

### 7.0 SessionManager and ManagedSession Interfaces

These are the core interfaces that live on the worker node. The orchestration calls into these via the `SessionProxy` (see §3.1.1).

```typescript
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// SessionManager — singleton per worker node
// Owns session lifecycle, wraps CopilotClient.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

interface SessionManager {
    // ─── Session access ──────────────────────────────

    /** Get existing session or create/resume one. */
    getOrCreate(sessionId: string, config: SessionConfig): Promise<ManagedSession>;

    /** Get session by ID (null if not in memory on this node). */
    get(sessionId: string): ManagedSession | null;

    // ─── Lifecycle ───────────────────────────────────

    /** Dehydrate: destroy in memory → tar → upload to blob → update CMS. */
    dehydrate(sessionId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>;

    /** Shutdown: destroy all sessions, stop CopilotClient. */
    shutdown(): Promise<void>;

    /** List all in-memory session IDs on this node. */
    activeSessionIds(): string[];
}

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ManagedSession — one per Copilot session
// Wraps CopilotSession, owns event handling and CMS writes.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

interface ManagedSession {
    /** Session identity. */
    readonly sessionId: string;

    // ─── Turn execution ──────────────────────────────

    /**
     * Run one LLM turn.
     * Uses send() + on() internally — never sendAndWait().
     * Blocks until a yield-worthy event:
     *   - session.idle       → {type: "completed"}
     *   - wait tool fires    → {type: "wait"}
     *   - ask_user fires     → {type: "input_required"}
     *   - abort received     → {type: "cancelled"}
     *   - error              → {type: "error"}
     */
    runTurn(prompt: string, opts?: TurnOptions): Promise<TurnResult>;

    /**
     * Abort the current in-flight message.
     * Session remains alive for future runTurn() calls.
     */
    abort(): Promise<void>;

    // ─── Configuration (applied on next runTurn) ─────

    updateConfig(config: Partial<ManagedSessionConfig>): void;

    // ─── Cleanup ─────────────────────────────────────

    /**
     * Destroy: release resources, detach on() handler,
     * flush CopilotSession to disk, remove from SessionManager.
     */
    destroy(): Promise<void>;
}

// ─── Supporting types ────────────────────────────────

interface TurnOptions {
    onDelta?: (delta: string) => void;
    onToolStart?: (name: string, args: any) => void;
}

type TurnResult =
    | { type: "completed"; content: string }
    | { type: "wait"; seconds: number; reason: string; content?: string }
    | { type: "input_required"; question: string; choices?: string[]; allowFreeform?: boolean }
    | { type: "cancelled" }
    | { type: "error"; message: string };

interface SessionConfig {
    model?: string;
    systemMessage?: string | SystemMessageConfig;
    tools?: Tool[];
    workingDirectory?: string;
    hooks?: SessionHooks;
}
```

**Key design points:**

1. **`runTurn()` uses `send()` + per-turn `on()` subscriptions** — listeners are attached inside each turn to capture deltas, tool starts, terminal events, and full event traces.

2. **Event persistence is activity-driven** — `runTurn` activity passes an `onEvent` callback that records non-ephemeral events to CMS as they fire.

3. **`abort()` does not destroy the session** — it cancels the in-flight message. The session returns to idle and is ready for the next `runTurn()` call.

4. **Config updates apply on subsequent turns** — `SessionManager` can update warm-session config, and `ManagedSession.runTurn()` re-registers tools every turn.

5. **`destroy()` releases local session resources** — used before dehydration/shutdown and during explicit delete flows.

### 7.1 Orchestration: `durable-session-v2`

One orchestration per session. Long-lived, event-driven main loop.
Uses the `SessionProxy` to call into the `SessionManager` / `ManagedSession` interface.

```typescript
function* durableSessionOrchestration(ctx, input) {
    let iteration = input.iteration ?? 0;
    let affinityKey = input.affinityKey ?? input.sessionId;
    let needsHydration = input.needsHydration ?? false;

    // SessionProxy — orchestration's view of the remote session
    let session = createSessionProxy(ctx, input.sessionId, affinityKey, input.config);

    // Helper: dehydrate + reset affinity + get new proxy
    function* dehydrateAndReset(reason: string): Generator<any, void, any> {
        yield session.dehydrate(reason);
        needsHydration = true;
        affinityKey = yield ctx.newGuid();
        session = createSessionProxy(ctx, input.sessionId, affinityKey, input.config);
    }

    // ─── MAIN LOOP ──────────────────────────────────────
    while (true) {
        // ① DEQUEUE next message
        setCustomStatus(ctx, "idle", { iteration });
        const msg = yield ctx.dequeueEvent("messages");
        const data = JSON.parse(msg);

        // ② DISPATCH by message type
        switch (data.type) {
            case "abort": {
                // If a turn is running, it was already cancelled by the race.
                // Just loop back to dequeue.
                continue;
            }

            case "destroy": {
                // Graceful shutdown
                if (blobEnabled) {
                    yield* dehydrateAndReset("destroy");
                }
                return "destroyed";
            }

            case "cmd": {
                // Slash commands (set_model, list_models, get_info)
                yield* handleCommand(ctx, data, input, session, iteration);
                continue;
            }

            default: {
                // Regular prompt
                const prompt = data.prompt;

                // ③ HYDRATE if needed
                if (needsHydration && blobEnabled) {
                    affinityKey = yield ctx.newGuid();
                    session = createSessionProxy(ctx, input.sessionId, affinityKey, input.config);
                    yield session.hydrate();
                    needsHydration = false;
                }

                // ④ RUN TURN (race against next message for abort/interrupt)
                setCustomStatus(ctx, "running", { iteration });
                const turnActivity = session.runTurn(prompt);  // ← reads like a method call
                const interruptMsg = ctx.dequeueEvent("messages");
                const race = yield ctx.race(turnActivity, interruptMsg);

                if (race.index === 1) {
                    // Interrupt arrived — running turn is cancelled by race loser
                    const interruptData = JSON.parse(race.value);
                    if (interruptData.type === "abort") {
                        // Turn cancelled → copilotSession.abort() called on worker
                        setCustomStatus(ctx, "idle", { iteration, turnResult: { type: "cancelled" } });
                        continue;
                    }
                    // Other interrupt (new prompt while turn running) — 
                    // carry it into next loop iteration via continueAsNew
                    yield ctx.continueAsNew(continueInput({ prompt: interruptData.prompt }));
                    return "";
                }

                // Turn completed — handle result
                const result = JSON.parse(race.value);
                iteration++;

                // ⑤ HANDLE RESULT
                switch (result.type) {
                    case "completed":
                        setCustomStatus(ctx, "idle", { iteration, turnResult: result });
                        // Race: next message vs idle dehydration timeout
                        if (blobEnabled && idleTimeout >= 0) {
                            const nextMsg = ctx.dequeueEvent("messages");
                            const idleTimer = ctx.scheduleTimer(idleTimeout * 1000);
                            const idleRace = yield ctx.race(nextMsg, idleTimer);

## 8. Sub-Agent Architecture

### 8.1 Overview

The runtime supports **autonomous sub-agents** — child sessions that run as independent durable orchestrations. A parent session can spawn sub-agents to work on tasks in parallel, each with its own conversation, tools, and LLM context.

Sub-agents are not sub-orchestrations in the duroxide sense. Each sub-agent is a full orchestration instance (`session-{childSessionId}`) created via the `PilotSwarmClient` SDK path. The parent orchestration tracks children in its `subAgents[]` array, which is carried across `continueAsNew` boundaries.

### 8.2 Built-in Agent Tools

Seven tools are injected into every session by `ManagedSession` to enable sub-agent delegation:

| Tool | Parameters | TurnResult type | What it does |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `spawn_agent` | `task`, `system_message?`, `model?`, `tool_names?` | `spawn_agent` | Creates a child session + orchestration. Returns agent ID. |
| `message_agent` | `agent_id`, `message` | `message_agent` | Sends a follow-up message to a running sub-agent. |
| `check_agents` | — | `check_agents` | Returns status of all sub-agents (running/completed/failed). |
| `wait_for_agents` | `agent_ids?` | `wait_for_agents` | Blocks until sub-agents finish. Returns their results. |
| `complete_agent` | `agent_id` | `complete_agent` | Marks a sub-agent as completed and stops its orchestration. |
| `cancel_agent` | `agent_id`, `reason?` | `cancel_agent` | Cancels a running sub-agent. |
| `delete_agent` | `agent_id`, `reason?` | `delete_agent` | Deletes a sub-agent entirely. |

These tools abort the current turn (like `wait` and `ask_user`) — the `ManagedSession` detects the tool call, captures the arguments, and returns a typed `TurnResult` to the orchestration. The orchestration then performs the durable operation.

### 8.3 Orchestration-Level Handling

When `runTurn()` returns a sub-agent TurnResult, the orchestration handles it:

```
spawn_agent:
  1. Call spawnChildSession activity → creates child session via SDK
  2. Add to subAgents[] array with status "running"
  3. Send result back to parent LLM as next prompt

message_agent:
  1. Call sendToSession activity → enqueues message on child's event queue
  2. Resume parent LLM with confirmation

check_agents:
  1. Call getStatus() for each sub-agent
  2. Collect statuses + latest results
  3. Resume parent LLM with status summary

wait_for_agents:
  1. Poll child orchestration statuses via getStatus()
  2. Wait (with timeout) until all specified children reach terminal state
  3. Resume parent LLM with collected results

complete_agent / cancel_agent / delete_agent:
  1. Send completion/cancellation message to child orchestration
  2. Update subAgents[] entry status
  3. Resume parent LLM with confirmation
```

### 8.4 Nesting and Limits

- **Max concurrent sub-agents per session:** 8 (`MAX_SUB_AGENTS`)
- **Max nesting depth:** 2 levels (root → child → grandchild, `MAX_NESTING_LEVEL`)
- Sub-agents inherit the parent's tools and model by default (overridable via `tool_names` and `model` parameters)
- Sub-agents are fully durable — they survive crashes, restarts, and node migrations independently
- The `subAgents[]` array is carried across `continueAsNew` boundaries

### 8.5 Parent–Child Communication

Child sessions communicate with their parent via `sendToSession` — a general-purpose activity that enqueues a message on any session's event queue. Children also report completion status through their orchestration's `customStatus`, which the parent polls via `getStatus()`.

The CMS tracks parent–child relationships via the `parentSessionId` column on the sessions table. The TUI uses this to render a tree view of sessions.

### 8.6 Data Flow

```
Parent Orchestration                           Child Orchestration
  │                                              │

  │   │                                           │
  │   └─ spawnChildSession activity ──────────────┤
  │      (creates child via PilotSwarmClient)  │
  │                                               │ runTurn(task)
  │ runTurn("agent spawned: {id}")                │   │
  │   │                                           │   └─► LLM works...
  │   └─► LLM continues...                       │
  │                                               │ setCustomStatus(result)
  │ runTurn → check_agents                        │

```

## 9. Orchestration Versioning

Orchestration code is **replayed from the beginning** on every new event. Changing the sequence of `yield` statements (adding, removing, or reordering) creates a new version that is incompatible with in-flight orchestrations recorded under the old yield sequence.

### 9.1 Versioning Strategy

Each version is a separate file:

```
src/orchestration_1_0_0.ts   — v1.0.0 (original)
src/orchestration_1_0_1.ts   — v1.0.1 (added sub-agents)
src/orchestration_1_0_2.ts   — v1.0.2 (added task context)
src/orchestration_1_0_3.ts   — v1.0.3 (added agent management tools)
src/orchestration.ts         — current development version (1.0.4)
```

All versions are registered in the duroxide runtime. In-flight orchestrations continue using their original version. New orchestrations use the latest.

### 9.2 When to Create a New Version

- Adding or removing `yield` statements
- Changing the order of yielded actions
- Adding or removing `setCustomStatus()` calls (these are recorded in duroxide history)
- Changing the `continueAsNew` input shape in a way that breaks deserialization

### 9.3 Safe Changes (No New Version Needed)

- Changing activity implementation (activity bodies run in normal code, not replayed)
- Changing `ManagedSession` logic
- Adding new tools to `ManagedSession`
- Changing CMS queries

---

## 10. Extensibility

### 10.1 Agent Definitions (.agent.md)

The runtime loads `.agent.md` files from a configurable plugin directory. Each file defines a reusable agent persona with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: planner
description: Creates structured plans for complex tasks.
tools:
  - view
  - grep
---

# Planner Agent
You are a planning agent. Break tasks into steps...
```

The YAML `name` and `description` become agent metadata. The markdown body becomes the agent's system message. The `tools` list specifies which worker-registered tools the agent can use.

Agents are loaded by `AgentLoader` and surfaced as spawnable sub-agents.

### 10.2 Skills (SKILL.md)

Skills are knowledge modules loaded from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Each skill provides domain-specific instructions:

```yaml
---
name: durable-timers
description: Expert knowledge on durable timer patterns.
---

# Durable Timer Patterns
You are running in a durable execution environment...
```

Skills are injected into the system message to give LLMs domain expertise. A skill directory can also include a `tools.json` file listing tools the skill requires:

```json
{ "tools": ["wait", "check_agents"] }
```

### 10.3 MCP Servers (.mcp.json)

External tool servers following the Model Context Protocol can be configured via `.mcp.json` files:

```json
{
  "my-server": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["server.js"],
    "tools": ["*"]
  },
  "remote-api": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
    "tools": ["query"],
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${MCP_TOKEN}" }
  }
}
```

MCP servers support both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP/SSE) transports. Environment variable references (`${VAR}`) in string values are expanded at load time.

---

## 11. Key Invariants

1. **CMS is the source of truth for session lifecycle.** The client writes to CMS before making duroxide calls. If the client disconnects and reconnects, it reads session state from CMS — not from duroxide. Duroxide state is eventually consistent with CMS.

2. **The orchestration never reads or writes CMS.** It talks to the `SessionProxy` and the event queue. Control flow and data flow are cleanly separated.

3. **The `SessionManager` / `ManagedSession` never make durable decisions.** They execute and return a result. The orchestration decides what to do with the result (timer, dehydrate, idle, etc.).

4. **The CopilotSession survives across orchestration turns.** When `runTurn()` returns, the session stays alive in `SessionManager` — the next `runTurn()` finds it there. Dehydration is the orchestration's decision, not automatic on every turn.

5. **We never call `sendAndWait()` internally.** Always `send()` + `on()`. This gives the ManagedSession full control over the turn lifecycle — intercept tools, stream deltas, detect abort — instead of being a blackbox blocking call.

6. **CMS writes are idempotent.** `session_id` is the primary key, `createSession` uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, `updateSession` uses `UPDATE ... WHERE session_id = $1`. Retries and duplicate calls are safe.

7. **One orchestration per session, sub-agents are independent orchestrations.** The orchestration ID is `session-{sessionId}`. Sub-agents spawn new orchestrations via the `PilotSwarmClient` SDK — they are not sub-orchestrations of the parent. The parent tracks children in its `subAgents[]` array. Max 8 concurrent sub-agents per parent, max 2 nesting levels.

8. **CMS access is provider-based.** All reads and writes go through the `SessionCatalogProvider` interface. The initial implementation is PostgreSQL; CosmosDB or other backends can be added without changing client or orchestration code.

9. **Sub-agent TurnResults abort the current turn.** Like `wait` and `ask_user`, sub-agent tools (`spawn_agent`, `message_agent`, etc.) abort the in-flight CopilotSession turn. The `ManagedSession` captures the tool arguments and returns a typed `TurnResult` to the orchestration, which performs the durable operation and resumes the LLM with the result.

10. **Orchestration versions are immutable.** Once an orchestration version is deployed and has in-flight instances, its yield sequence cannot change. New versions are separate files. All versions remain registered so in-flight instances continue on their original version.
