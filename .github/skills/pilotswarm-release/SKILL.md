# PilotSwarm Release

Use this skill when a user wants to prepare or cut a release of PilotSwarm.

Keep the workflow tight and deterministic. The goal is to verify what will ship, fix release blockers, and only then commit, push, tag, and publish.

Treat this as a `pilotswarm`-repo maintainer workflow only. Do not update downstream consumers, sample app forks outside this repo, or vendored PilotSwarm copies in other repositories unless the user explicitly asks for that separate follow-up.

## Release Workflow

1. Inspect the release surface.
   - Run `git status --short`.
   - Check changed runtime, docs, templates, examples, and workflow files.
   - Check the latest existing git tag with `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head`.
   - Check current package names and versions in `packages/sdk/package.json` and `packages/cli/package.json`.
   - Report the current latest tag and the proposed next tag to the user before any tag is created.
   - Check whether each published workspace package has its own `README.md`.

2. Verify feature-completeness around the change.
   - If behavior changed, confirm the canonical docs in `docs/` were updated.
   - Confirm the DevOps sample in `examples/devops-command-center/` still reflects the shipped behavior.
   - Confirm relevant builder templates in `templates/builder-agents/` were updated when builder-facing behavior changed.
   - Confirm `.github/copilot-instructions.md` was updated if contributor workflow or maintenance expectations changed.
   - **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** with a new top entry for the proposed version, dated, summarizing what shipped (SDK / Portal / TUI / Tests / Maintainer Workflow / npm sections as appropriate). The CHANGELOG entry is a release blocker, not optional.
   - **Update the repo-root `README.md` banner line** that calls out the latest version (e.g. `**v0.1.X** — ...`) so the repo landing page matches the version about to ship.

3. Run build and full test suite.
   - Start with `npm run build`.
   - Run the **full** local integration test suite before any release:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/run-tests.sh
     ```
     All suites must pass. Do not skip suites or accept partial runs for an official release.
    - If the full suite fails, identify the specific failing test files and rerun those failing tests sequentially a few times, for example:
       ```bash
       ./scripts/run-tests.sh --sequential <suite-name>
       ```
       or run the specific file directly with `npx vitest run <path-to-test>`.
    - If the previously failing tests pass repeatedly in sequential mode, treat the failure as a parallel-run flake in the test harness and continue with the release. Call this out explicitly in the release notes.
   - If a test fails, investigate and fix the root cause. Do not silence failures or weaken assertions to proceed.
   - If package contents matter, run:
     ```bash
     npm pack --dry-run
     ```
     from `packages/sdk` and `packages/cli`.

4. Validate npm-release wiring.
   - Check `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml`.
   - Check `.github/workflows/publish-starter-docker.yml` if the starter appliance or Docker release path changed.
   - Confirm publish targets, access level, provenance flags, and required secrets still match the intended release.
   - Confirm each published package has correct `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` metadata for npm provenance verification.
   - Confirm built-in PilotSwarm plugins that must ship with the SDK are included by package `files` config.
   - Confirm package-local `README.md` files are actually present in `npm pack --dry-run` output for each workspace package.
   - If package names, publish workflow wiring, Docker publish wiring, or npm metadata changed, run the relevant CI workflow in dry-run or manual mode from `main` before tagging a real release when practical.

5. Prepare release notes for the user.
   - Summarize what changed.
   - List what was verified.
   - State the current latest git tag and the proposed next tag.
   - Ask whether the user wants the GitHub Release to trigger the starter Docker image publish as well.
   - Call out blockers or skipped checks explicitly.

6. Commit and push only with explicit user approval.
   - Use non-interactive git commands.
   - Do not amend unless the user explicitly asks.
   - Prefer a commit message that describes the release-ready outcome, not just one file.

7. Tag and publish only with explicit user approval.
   - Create an annotated tag for the release version.
   - Push the commit and tag.
   - Create a **GitHub Release** from the tag using `gh release create`. The npm publish workflow (`publish-npm.yml`) triggers on `release: [published]`, **not** on tag push alone. Without a GitHub Release, the publish will not run.
   - If the user opted in, note that the same GitHub Release should also trigger `.github/workflows/publish-starter-docker.yml`.
   - If the user does not want the Docker starter published as part of the release, call that out explicitly and use the manual starter Docker workflow later if needed.
   - Include a concise release notes summary in the GitHub Release body.
   - If a manual workflow dispatch is used instead, report the exact inputs used.

8. Verify publication.
   - Check that the GitHub Actions publish workflow started and completed using `gh run list --workflow=publish-npm.yml`.
   - Report the published package names and versions.
   - Verify the registry directly with `npm view <package> version`.
   - If the release included the starter Docker image, also verify the published image tags directly with:
     ```bash
     docker buildx imagetools inspect docker.io/<user>/pilotswarm-starter:<tag>
     ```
     Confirm at least the release tag, bare version tag, and `latest` resolve successfully.
   - If publish failed, surface the workflow error rather than guessing.

## Release Checklist

- build passes
- full test suite passes (`./scripts/run-tests.sh`) or any failing suites pass repeatedly when rerun sequentially
- sample app still reflects shipped behavior
- relevant docs and guides are updated
- relevant builder templates are updated
- **`CHANGELOG.md` has a new top entry for the proposed version**
- **repo-root `README.md` banner line names the proposed version**
- package metadata is correct
- `npm pack --dry-run` looks right
- package-local `README.md` files are present for published workspaces
- provenance metadata (`repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`) is correct
- latest tag and proposed next tag were reported
- Docker starter publish intent was confirmed with the user
- release Docker tags were verified directly when applicable
- commit, push, and tag are complete
- publish workflow ran successfully

## Current Package Surface

PilotSwarm publishes the following packages (in dependency/publish order):

1. `pilotswarm-sdk` — SDK runtime
2. `pilotswarm-cli` — terminal UI (depends on sdk; bundles ui-core and ui-react)
3. `pilotswarm-web` — browser portal (depends on cli; bundles ui-core and ui-react)

`pilotswarm-ui-core` and `pilotswarm-ui-react` are workspace-only packages (`"private": true`). They ship inside `pilotswarm-cli` and `pilotswarm-web` via `bundledDependencies` — they are never published to npm independently.

If package names change later, update this skill in the same change.

## Notes

- Prefer fixing brittle tests over loosening product behavior just to get green.
- If a test failure is caused by stale hardcoded assumptions such as old model names, update the test to follow the current repo contract.
- npm package pages for workspace publishes come from the workspace-local `README.md`, not the repo-root README.
- When provenance is enabled for npm publish, mismatched or missing repository metadata is a release blocker, not a cosmetic issue.
- Treat the release agent as a maintainer workflow for this repository, not as an app-builder template.
