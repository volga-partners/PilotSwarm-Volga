# PilotSwarm Builder Agents

These are distributable Copilot custom-agent templates for users who are building apps on top of PilotSwarm.

They are not active in this repository. Copy them into the target repository you want to assist.

## Included Agents

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder` — scaffolds plugin-driven CLI/TUI apps built on the shipped PilotSwarm UI
- `pilotswarm-portal-builder` — scaffolds browser-portal customization, portal branding, and auth add-on wiring
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder` — scaffolds SDK-first apps and services built around `PilotSwarmClient` and `PilotSwarmWorker`
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer` — prepares PilotSwarm-based apps for Azure / AKS deployment, including env templates, manifests, and worker observability

## Included Skills (split for focused retrieval)

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder` — CLI/TUI scaffold guidance, env files, launcher scripts
- `pilotswarm-portal-builder` — portal branding, `plugin.json.portal`, auth add-ons, and deployment wiring
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder` — SDK app scaffold guidance, client/worker split, tests
- `pilotswarm-duroxide-versioning` — durable orchestration versioning, continue-as-new upgrades, compatibility rules
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer` — deployment workflow, manifests, env checklist, `RUST_LOG` observability
- `pilotswarm-aks-identity` — cross-cluster AKS access, Workload Identity, kubectl patterns
- `pilotswarm-azure-lessons` — RBAC conditional access workaround, PostgreSQL region restrictions, Key Vault + CSI
- `pilotswarm-three-tier` — dedicated worker-cluster topology for long-running or dehydration-resistant jobs

These templates assume apps consume:

- `pilotswarm-sdk`
- `pilotswarm-cli`

from npm:

```bash
npm install pilotswarm-sdk
npm install pilotswarm-cli
```

and that PilotSwarm's built-in framework and management plugins are embedded in those packages while app `default.agent.md` files act as app-wide overlays.

If the target app needs a custom model catalog, check in `.model_providers.example.json`, create a local gitignored `.model_providers.json` from it, and keep actual credentials in `.env` / `.env.remote`. Runnable scaffolds should copy and adapt PilotSwarm's own example files, set up both `.env` and `.model_providers.json` from those corresponding examples, and add the real files to `.gitignore`.

PilotSwarm includes built-in facts tools (`store_fact`, `read_facts`, `delete_fact`) on workers, and they are available to every agent session by default, including system agents. Use them for durable structured memory and shared cross-agent state instead of inventing an app-specific facts table unless the app truly needs one.

The CLI builder template also assumes runnable scaffolds should:

- generate checked-in launcher and cleanup scripts
- make those scripts executable
- verify direct script execution rather than only relying on `node script.js`

## Maintenance Rule

If PilotSwarm adds features or changes behavior relevant to app builders, update these templates as part of the same change whenever practical.
