# PilotSwarm Builder Agents

These are distributable Copilot custom-agent templates for users who are building apps on top of PilotSwarm.

They are not active in this repository. Copy them into the target repository you want to assist.

## Included Agents

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder` — scaffolds plugin-driven CLI/TUI apps built on the shipped PilotSwarm UI
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder` — scaffolds SDK-first apps and services built around `PilotSwarmClient` and `PilotSwarmWorker`
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer` — prepares PilotSwarm-based apps for Azure / AKS deployment, including env templates, workload identity, and cross-cluster AKS guidance
